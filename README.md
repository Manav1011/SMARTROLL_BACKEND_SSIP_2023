- **Security Measures:** Face recognition and signal strength analysis for student verification and physical presence confirmation.

- **Timetable Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with academic schedules for easy session-wise attendance tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django (Python web framework) for server-side development.
  
- **Mobile App:** Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.
